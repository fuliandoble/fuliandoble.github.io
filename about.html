                <div class="about-content">
                    <p>I graduated from the University of Manchester with a Distinction in Spoken Chinese. I was also honoured to receive the award for Best Performance at the <a href=â€œhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNDVx9S5CjM&t=12735s target="_blank" >2023 Chinese Bridge UK National Competition</a> and was given the chance to go to China and observe the global finals. </p>
                    <p>As an adoptee from China, I am an active member of <a href="https://cach.org.uk/" target="_blank" >CACH-ALL,</a> a charity that connects adoptees and families, where I am currently serving on the committee as the webmaster.  </p>
                    <p>Since 2021, I have been spearheading a campaign called 'Decolonise East Asian Studies' which works to tackle areas that the curriculum has missed related to the East Asian experience. For example, British Chinese diaspora, Gender and Race, racism etc.</p>
                    <p>I am an experienced public speaker, having been invited to speak on decolonising and the adoptee experience for CACH-ALL both as a panellist and individual (2023), the University of Manchester for their symposium on decolonising the curriculum (2023) and at the Liverpool esea network's online event <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-liverpool/scattered-belongings-online-event"target="_blank" >'Scattering Belongings'</a> (2024).</p>
                    <p> Furthermore, I am a professional opera singer, having studied at the RNCM under Susan Roper. I also possess a diploma in voice and piano. Currently I sing Soprano 1 in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ScholaApium" target="_blank" >Schola Apium</a>, a chamber choir in Manchester.</p>
